        <!--pic would go here-->
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is how to render your own lard from pig fat.</p>
        <p>Lard is 60% unsaturated fat, so it's pretty healthy for you, and it makes mexican food taste amazing.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>pig back fat</li>
            <li>water (to prevent burning)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>fill a sauce pan with just enough water to coat the bottom of the pan</li>
            <li>put the sauce pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>cut up the pig back fat into small bite-sized chunks</li>
            <li>add the fat to the now-heated sauce pan. The water will evaporate off as the pan heats and the lard is graually rendered out of the fat.</li>
            <li>You'll need to keep an eye on it and move around the chunks of fat. You'll know you've gotten all of the lard rendered once of the bits of fat are shriveled up and hard.</li>
        </ol>
