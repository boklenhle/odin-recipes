        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>24oz cream cheese (softened)</li>
            <li>5 tablespoon unsalted butter (softened)</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioner's swerve sweetener (the powdered swerve)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sour cream (room temp)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 large eggs (room temp)</li>

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>an Oven</li>
            <li>9in. Springform Pan</li>
            <li>Hand Mixer</li>
            <li>Zester (or something to peel very small pieces of zest off a lemon)</li>
            <li>Roasting Pan large enough that you can put the springform pan in without the edges touching</li>
            <li>measuring cups and spoons</li>
            <li>a Pan to boil water in</li>
            <li>Parchment Paper (NOT wax paper)</li>
            <li>Aluminium Foil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>preheat oven to 300F and grease a 9 inch springform pan. cut out a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of it and then grease that too. Wrap two pieces of aluminium foil around the pan so it covers the entire bottom and at least half way up the sides (very important it covers all the way around half way up the sides)</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Be sure to scrape sides and beaters down as needed.</li>
            <li>Start boiling water. We're eventually going to be putting the springform pan in the roasting pan. And we need enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Add the sour cream, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating each until just barely combined.</li>
            <li>pour into prepared springform pan and smooth the top.</li>
            <li>place springform pan inside roasting pan large enough that the sides of the spring form don't touch the roasting pan.</li>
            <li>pour boiling water into roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the springform pan.</li>
            <li>bake 70-90 min, until cheesecake is mostly set but still jiggles just a little in the middle.</li>
            <li>remove roasting pan and springform pan from the oven. Carefully remove springform pan from the water.</li>
            <li>let springform cool until room temp</li>
            <li>run a sharp knife around the edges of the cake to losen. Then release the springform pan. Refrigerate for at least four hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
