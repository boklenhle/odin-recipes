        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the 4 cups of cabbage finely (about half a cabbage)</li>
            <li>saute the cabbage in a pan over medium heat with a bit of oil until it's wilted to half its original volume.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cabbage to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Chop up the green onions, garlic, and grate the ginger.</li>
            <li>Mix the green onions, garlic, ginger, pork, soy sauce, and sesame oil all into the cabbage. </li>
            <li>Massage the mixture with your hands until it's mixed evenly. It should be slightly sticky or tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li>Spoon about a tsp of the mixture into the middle of the wonton wrapper.</li>
            <li>Wet the edges of the wrapper (dip your finger into some water and run it over the edges).</li>
            <li>Fold the wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to seal.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the gyoza, heat 1 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add the gyoza with the seam side up, and fry until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Using the lid as a shield, pour about 1/4 to 1/3 cup water into the skillet and quickly place the lid on top to contain the steam and splatter. Let the gyoza steam in the skillet for 1-2 minutes, or until most of the liquid has boiled away. Remove the lid and let the gyoza cook for a minute more, or until the bottom is crispy again. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

<p>Note, the gyoza are usually served with a sauce made out of a 2:1 ratio of soy sauce:rice vinegar. Also, you can add red pepper flakes for a nice kick.</p>
