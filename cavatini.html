    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe my Grandma created when pizza hut stopped selling their cavatini (sometime in the 90s, I think? She was trying to recreate their recipe, and accidentally created this masterpiece of fine cuisine.</p>
    <p>This is a sort of half-spicy lasagna cassarole dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 white onion</li>
        <li>garlic - 2 or three cloves</li>
        <li>3 organic mixed mini bell peppers</li>
        <li>3.5 cups of pasta</li>
        <li>1 jar of bertolli's tomato and basil sauce</li>
        <li>14 oz can of diced tomatos</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno or 1 can of rotel diced peppers</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>2 bags of cheese (those smaller bags) either mozzarella, pizza blend, or four cheese blend)</li>
        <li>(optional) mushrooms</li>
        <li>bag of pepperonis (the smaller bag)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>start cooking the 3.5 cups of pasta (we're going to leave it half uncooked - still a bit crunchy)</li>
        <li>brown the burger with onions and peppers while the pasta is cooking (make sure the peppers only cook about half way)</li>
        <li>separate and add half the bag of pepperonis to the hamburger mix and stir it all together.</li>
        <li>once the pasta is <strong>only half way</strong> cooked, drain it, and stir in the bertolli, diced tomatos, and rotel/japapeno</li>
        <li>combine the pasta and hamburger mixtures into one pot</li>
        <li>add generous salt and pepper and stir some more</li>
        <li>put it all into a cassarole dish</li>
        <li>put the cheese on the very top</li>
        <li>bake at 350F for about 25 min or until cheese is bubbling and browned</li>
   </ol>
