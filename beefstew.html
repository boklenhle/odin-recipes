        <h1>Beef Stew</h1>
        <!--pic would go here-->
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This was originally a keto recipe I found back in 2016 online. It appears the original has been taken down, and I've forgotten the original spices, so to make it easy, I just use a store-bought beef stew seasoning packet.</p>
